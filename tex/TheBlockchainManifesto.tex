\noindent The allignment of Ethereum Classic with The Blockchain Alliance for
Good promotes the usage of blockchain technology as a sustainable vehicle to do
good rather than evil. Based on The Blockchain Alliance for Good's
Manifesto\cite{Perlroth2014}, these are the principles that guide our mission to
promote openness, innovation \& opportunity on the Blockchain.

\section{Introduction}

\lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{T}he Blockchain is becoming an increasingly
important part of our lives. The Ethereum Classic (ETC) project is a global
community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are
key to the continued health of the Blockchain. We have worked together since
2016 to ensure that the Blockchain is developed in a way that benefits everyone.

The Ethereum Classic project uses a community based approach to create
world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative
activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Blockchain
experience better for all of us.

As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we
believe are critical for the Blockchain to continue to benefit the public good
as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.

The goals for the Manifesto are to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item articulate a vision for ETC participants want
  Ethereum Classic to pursue;
  \item speak to people whether or not they have a technical
background;
  \item make ETC contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us
to continue;
  \item and provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of
the Blockchain.
\end{itemize}

These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make
the Blockchain open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working
together in groups, and leading others. Ethereum Classic is
committed to advancing the principles set out in the ETC's Manifesto. We
invite others to join us and make the Blockchain an ever better place for
everyone.

\section{Principles}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Blockchain is an integral part of modern life - a key component in
  education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society
  as a whole.
  \item The Blockchain is a global public resource that must remain open and
  accessible.
  \item The Blockchain must enrich the lives of individual human beings.
  \item Individuals’ security and privacy on the Blockchain are fundamental and
must not be treated as optional.
  \item Individuals must have the ability to shape the Blockchain and their own
experiences on it.
  \item The effectiveness of the Blockchain as a public resource depends upon
interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and
decentralized participation worldwide.
  \item Free and open source software promotes the development of the Blockchain
as a public resource.
  \item Transparent community-based processes promote participation,
  accountability and trust.
  \item Commercial involvement in the development of the Blockchain brings many
 benefits; a balance between commercial profit and public benefit is critical.
  \item Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Blockchain is an important
   goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Advancing the Blockchain Manifesto}
There are many different ways of advancing the principles of ETC's
Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same
creativity that ETC participants have shown in other areas of the project.
For individuals not deeply involved in the Ethereum Classic project,
one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use
Ethereum Classic Decentralized applications ({\DH}apps) and other products that
embody the principles of the Manifesto.

\section{Ethereum Classic Pledge}
Ethereum Classic pledges to support the Alliance's Manifesto in
its activities. Specifically, we will:

\begin{itemize}
  \item build and enable open-source technologies and communities that support
  the Manifesto’s principles;
  \item build and deliver great consumer products that support the Manifesto’s
  principles;
  \item use Ethereum Classic assets (intellectual property such as copyrights and
  trademarks, infrastructure, funds, and reputation) to keep the Blockchain an
  open platform;
  \item promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit;
  \item and promote Ethereum Classic's Manifesto principles in public discourse and
  within the Blockchain industry.
\end{itemize}

Some ETC activities—currently the creation, delivery and promotion of
consumer products are conducted primarily through the development teams efforts.
Entrepreneurs are invited to form new teams and boost the development of
Ethereum Classic eco-system.

As also happened in the early internet days, the lack of skilled
blockchain developers is also a major concern of Ethereum Classic and has
potential to be addressed by strategic partnerships with educational institutions.

\section{Invitation}

Ethereum Classic invites all others who support the principles of the
ETC's Manifesto to join with us, and to find new ways to make this vision
of the Blockchain a reality.
